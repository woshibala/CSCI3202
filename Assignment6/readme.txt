I use "/" instead of "|"
So you can test the program by usind command lines such as "-gp/ds"
Also, I don't have enough time to make the program user friendly.
The sequence of the command is important.
e.g.
You may not get answer by entering "-gp/sd"
So, if the program doesn't give you answer just try a another sequence.
In order to change P(s), I use a file "ps.txt" to store the value.
You have to have this file, so that the "-p0.5" command can work.
